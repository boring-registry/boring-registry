      RegisterAlgorithmOption describes options that can be passed to the algorithm registering
      functions that support options such as RegisterKeyEncryptionAlgorithmWithOptions.
options:
  - ident: SymmetricAlgorithm
    interface: RegisterAlgorithmOption
    argument_type: bool
    comment: |
      WithSymmetricAlgorithm lets the library know whether the algorithm is symmetric. This affects
      the response of the `IsSymmetric` method of the algorithm. If the algorithms does not support
      this method, using this option will result in an error.
