# Installing from source

Pre-built binaries are available as [artifacts on the GitHub releases](https://github.com/boring-registry/boring-registry/releases).
The following steps might be helpful in case you want to build the binaries from source yourself.

Run `make` to build the project and install the `boring-registry` executable into `$GOPATH/bin`.
Then start the server with `$GOPATH/bin/boring-registry`, or if `$GOPATH/bin` is already in your `$PATH`, you can simply run `boring-registry`.
